              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>The National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office (NMIO) in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology Directorate (S&amp;T), and the U.S. Coast Guard needed a way to automate and fuse complex and disparate real-time data sources to determine ship risk for their maritime safety mission.</p>

              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>We used our open architecture design and machine learning to determine individual ship risk through the fusion of real-time terrestrial AIS data and real-time data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).</p>
